## ðŸš€ **HOW TO TEST:**

### **Step 1: Verify Servers are Running**
Both servers should be running:
- **Server**: `http://localhost:3000` âœ…
- **Client**: `http://localhost:5173` âœ…

### **Step 2: Test Drawing (Local)**
1. Open `http://localhost:5173`
2. You should see "Canvas ready!" toast message
3. **Try drawing on the canvas** - it should work immediately
4. Change colors and stroke width
5. Test the eraser tool

### **Step 3: Test Room Joining**
1. In the top-right corner, enter a room ID (e.g., "TEST123")
2. Click "Join Room" or press Enter
3. You should see "Joined room: TEST123" toast
4. The status bar should show "âœ¨ Collaborating in room: TEST123"

### **Step 4: Test Real-time Collaboration**
1. Open another browser window/tab
2. Go to `http://localhost:5173`
3. Join the same room ID ("TEST123")
4. Start drawing in one window
5. **You should see the strokes appear in real-time in the other window!**

## ðŸ”§ **TROUBLESHOOTING:**

### **If drawing doesn't work:**
- Check browser console (F12) for errors

- Check that both show "LIVE" status
- Verify both windows show the same user count
